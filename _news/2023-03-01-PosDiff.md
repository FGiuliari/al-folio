Our new work [**Positional Diffusion: Ordering Unordered Sets with Diffusion Probabilistic Models**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11120) is on ArXiv. 
We use Diffusion Probabilistic Models to generate the position of input elements in the continuous domain.
We use it to solve Puzzles üñºÔ∏è and order sentences ‚úçÔ∏è.

I'm a PhD student at the Pattern Analysis and Computer Vision ([PAVIS](https://pavis.iit.it/)) research line at the Italian Institute of Technology, led by [Dr. Alessio Del Bue](https://www.iit.it/it/people-details/-/people/alessio-delbue).

I'm very enthusiastic about deep learning applied to computer vision. Right now, my focus is on 3D reasoning with Graph Neural Networks. Previously, I worked on human trajectory forecasting and Object Navigation.

I enjoy listening to EDM, reading fiction, and playing tabletop Role-Playing Games in my free time.
